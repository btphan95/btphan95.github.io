<h2 id="the-retreat">The Retreat</h2>

<p>On February 28th, I embarked on my 2nd Vipassana meditation retreat, as taught by S.N. Goenka.  This second retreat took place at the Northern California Vipassana Center in Kelseyville, CA. Through my inner meditative work, I gained more clarity, a higher sense of purpose, a feeling of being in the flow, a marked increase in equinimity in dealing with life’s vicissitudes, and a rediscovery of what is important in my life.</p>

<p>In this 10-day vipassana meditation retreat, I meditated for 12 hours a day for 10 days. Accomodations were provided, and vegetarian meals were served twice a day. The most important rule that I had to follow was noble silence. For the entirety of the course, no talking, eye contact, or any kind of communication was allowed. That also meant no writing, reading, or use of any electronic devices. All of this was designed for the sole purpose of supporting one in focusing on the mind and the body.</p>

<p>The course could be simplified into a few words: observe and don’t react. While meditating, we were just asked to sit and observe our breath and our bodily sensations. That was easier said than done, since most of my time was preoccupied with thoughts, but over time, the mind and the ego started to lose its grip on my consciousness.</p>

<h2 id="the-benefits">The Benefits</h2>

<p>After 10 days, after what felt to be a surgery of the mind, I emerged with marked benefits. Firstly, I felt a sense of clarity in my perceived environment, where all my senses felt richer, more vibrant, and I felt fresh. I felt like parts of my ego died - thought patterns that no longer served me. Thoughts that involved stress, unworthiness, shame, and the mundane were replaced with thoughts that reflected on a higher sense of purpose, on well-being, on happiness, and health. I noticed that I was in a state of flow: things felt more natural to me, I was more at ease, and there was a sense of things happening at the right place at the right time. I also felt a sense of equinimity: that no matter what was going on around me, I could remain grounded and calm. This has been especially helpful during this unprecedented time in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Since the retreat, my practice has continued: I now meditate for two hours a day, one hour in the morning and one in the evening. It has been the month after the retreat of solid consistent practice where I’ve seen the biggest changes in my life. I am now more focused and productive than ever. I am more connected to those around me, and more present in my life. I have become frighteningly productive. My hope is that this practice will continue its momentum, and I’m very excited to see where it will take me. I also hope that this poset may serve to help you continue or start your own practice and reap the benefits.</p>
